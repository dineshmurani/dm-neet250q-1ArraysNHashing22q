"""
You are given an integer array nums and an integer val. Your task is to remove all occurrences of val from nums in-place.

After removing all occurrences of val, return the number of remaining elements, say k, such that the first k elements of nums do not contain val.

Note:

The order of the elements which are not equal to val does not matter.
It is not necessary to consider elements beyond the first k positions of the array.
To be accepted, the first k elements of nums must contain only elements not equal to val.
Return k as the final result.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,4], val = 1

Output: [2,3,4]
Explanation: You should return k = 3 as we have 3 elements which are not equal to val = 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2

Output: [0,1,3,0,4]
Explanation: You should return k = 5 as we have 5 elements which are not equal to val = 2.

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100
